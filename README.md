# The format of gesture

| Gesture | Acronym |
|---------|---------|
| Left    | L       |
| Up      | U       |
| Right   | R       |
| Down    | D       |
| Mouse L | Z       |

Z is the acronym of pinyin of '左' which means 'left' in English.
So to distinguish 'clicking the left mouse' from 'dragging your mouse left-ward',
we chose 'Z'.
